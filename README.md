### Hello World! 你好！ こんにちは！ 안녕하세요! Willkommen! 👋

☺ Since finishing studying Psychology at University, I have been teaching English abroad, aiming to inspire individuals and challenge my world perspective. I immersed myself in the culture and languages of in Japan, Korea and India. 

**However, along the way, I met programmers around the world who showed me how creative coding can be. 
I discovered that, through solving real world problems, tech can have a global impact**.

This inspired me to start a new adventure with code and continue to broaden my horizons. I joined the School of Code's intensive, full time bootcamp which was a push into the deep end of different technologies and core soft skills through Agile workflow and pair programming. 

**With this valuable experience and knowledge under my belt, I plan to continue on this upward trajectory to make a leap into the field of tech!
Check out my journey here on my GitHub profile :) Feel free to get in touch via Twitter / LinkedIn!** ☺

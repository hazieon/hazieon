### Hello World! 你好！ こんにちは！ 안녕하세요! Willkommen! 👋

☺ Since finishing studying Psychology at University, I have been teaching English abroad, aiming to inspire individuals and challenge my world perspective.
I immersed myself in the culture and languages of in Japan, Korea and India. 

However, along the way, I met programmers around the world who showed me how creative coding can be. 
I discovered that, through solving real world problems, tech can have a **global impact**.

This inspired me to start a new adventure with code and continue to broaden my horizons. I joined the School of Code's intensive, full time bootcamp which was a push into the deep end, learning a wide range of technologies, frameworks and languages. But beyond the tech skills, I developed core soft skills through Agile workflow and pair programming. In groups of 2-6, we built full stack projects in short sprints with tight deadlines. 

With this valuable experience and knowledge under my belt, I plan to continue on this upward trajectory to make a leap into the field of tech!
Check out my journey here on my GitHub profile :) ☺
